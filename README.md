# Robust and Efficient Writer-Independent IMU-Based Handwriting Recognition

This repository is the official implementation of "Robust and Efficient Writer-Independent IMU-Based Handwriting Recognition".

## Introduction

The paper introduces a handwriting recognition model for IMU-based data, leveraging a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. The model is designed to enhance recognition accuracy for unseen writers.

## Dataset

For commercial reasons, our datasets will not be published. Alternatively, you can use the OnHW public dataset for training and evaluation. In the paper, we use the right-handed writer-independent subset of the OnHW-words500 dataset. To download the dataset, please visit: https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/de/ff/lv/dataanalytics/anwproj/schreibtrainer/onhw-dataset.html

We use a MSCOCO-like structure for the training and evaluation of our dataset. After the OnHW dataset is downloaded, please convert the original dataset to the desired structure with the notebook `onhw.ipynb`. Please adjust the variables `dir_raw`, `dir_out`, and `writer_indep` accordingly.

## Training

In the paper, models are trained in a 5-fold cross validation style, which can be done using the `main.py` to train each fold individually. Please adjust the configurations in the `train.yaml` configuation file accordingly. Additionally, as competitor CLDNN is trained with different strategy, please always use the `*_cldnn.*` files for training and evaluation.

```bash
python main.py -c configs/train.yaml
python main_mohamad.py -c configs/train_mohamad.yaml # CLDNN only
```

Alternatively, you can also train all folds at once sequentially with `train_cv.py`. The script will generate configuration files for all folds in a `temp*` directory and run `main.py` with these configuration files sequentially. After the training is finished, the `temp*` directory will be deleted automatically.

```bash
python train_cv.py -c configs/train.yaml -m main.py
```

## Evaluation

As we are using cross validation, the results are already given in the output files of training. However, you can always re-evaluate the model with the configuration and weight you want. In the case, please ajust the `test.yaml` file accordingly and run `main.py` with it.

```bash
python main.py -c configs/test.yaml
```

After you get all results of all folds, you can summarize the results and also calculate the #Params and MACs with `evaluate.py`.

```bash
python evaluate.py -c configs/train.yaml
# or
python evaluate.py -c path_to_config_in_work_dir
```
